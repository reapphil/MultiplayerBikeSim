abstract = {Research on cyclists‘ safety and comfort is a growing topic. Existing works address support systems with novel interaction concepts such as augmented reality but also the design and evaluation of high-fidelity bicycle simulators. Since the field is still in its exploratory phase, there have been few attempts to systematically provide guidance for conducting experiments. For example, there is no consensus on the choice of representative driving scenarios, the proper choice of different bicycle simulators, and measurement standards to systematically compare the results of different studies. With this workshop, we want the community to gather and discuss a roadmap for the future of HCI bicycle research so that these issues can be overcome.},
